# YourGPT UI Components

An open-source UI component library and design system used by [YourGPT](https://yourgpt.ai/). This repository contains the building blocks and components that power YourGPT's modern and beautiful interface.

## Overview

This library provides a collection of reusable React components, design tokens, and UI patterns built with:

- Next.js 14+
- Tailwind CSS
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Beautiful and accessible components
- TypeScript

We've built this library on top of shadcn/ui, an amazing collection of re-usable components that prioritizes accessibility, customization, and developer experience. While shadcn/ui provides the foundation, we've extended it with:

- YourGPT-specific design tokens and themes
- Additional custom components
- AI-focused UI patterns and blocks
- Dark mode optimizations

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Components

Each component follows our design system guidelines and supports both light and dark modes.
